# Banking App
This is a personal project to try to simulate a functional banking system. The final goal is a online service that can be used from web or mobile clients. At the moment only the onboarding module is under development.
The project uses AWS to host and use some services. 

## Onboarding
The onboarding module is responsible for register and validate new costumers, relying on a documentoscopy service to advoid frauds.
